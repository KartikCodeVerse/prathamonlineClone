My deepest gratitude goes to PRATHAM TEST PREP for making this possible. The quality of classes was excellent and helped prepare for the actual tests. The quantity of resources, especially mock tests, given to us was immense; I was simply unable to complete all of them. The digital resources especially are very plentiful and easily accessible. The manner of teaching at PRATHAM is very engaging and allows you to focus on precisely the important points for each exam. With offline classes now beginning to resume this would be doubly so.",
